This project deals with basic manipulation of dataframes, formatting and setting for automatic sending a professional email with sales data

Main steps:
*	Importing libraries and dataframes
*	Manipulating databases to create indicators - using pandas
*	Formatting email content with HTML language
*	Setting email sending
Libraries: pandas

First, libraries are imported and data is manipulated, grouping by average and sum to generate the best visualizations in ordert to generate the best insights
Then, basic HTML language commands are used to configure texts and dataframes into a professional layout
Finally, libraries and simple codes are presented to automate sending emails â€“ in this case through gmail

The codes are done step by step, ideal for those who are giving their first stpes into python
